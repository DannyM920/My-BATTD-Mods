Adds 1000 cash to your total at the end of every round instead of the normal amount, but also adds 1000 cash two-three times when you start a new game.

Put BonusEndOfRoundCash.dll in your Mods folder after installing MelonLoader onto Bloons Adventure Time TD

Thanks to gurrenm3 for the template BTD6 mod, and to my friend MagneticPrism for the idea of making a separate method for the cash increase.
